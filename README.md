# Horiseon Digital Marketing

The goal of this project was to take an existing set of code provided to us by a client and optimize it for easy access on search engines. 

Clients rely on functional and concise code to display their information on the web for anyone that comes across this website. It is important to 
provide detailed information in the search results for users to get a glance at what Horiseon can provide. 

The code has been refracted for quality assurance and accessibility to anyone.
